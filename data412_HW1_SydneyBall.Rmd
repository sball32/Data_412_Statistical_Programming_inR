#Question 1:
Use and show R code to produce all even integers greater than 7 but less than 101
```{r}
seq(8, 100, 2) 
```

#Question 2:
Use and show R code to find the mean of all positive integers less than 100.
```{r}
mean(1:99)
```

#Question 3:
Write a function (using R code and the structure demonstrated in class) to
calculate a z-score for a given observed value, a mean, and a standard deviation
value. And then use your function to find a z score for the following problem.
(Research the internet to find the formula used to calculate a z score)

Observed value = 25.77, mean = 23.54, standard deviation = 2.442
```{r}
zscore<- function(o,m,sd)
  {result <- ((o-m)/sd)
    return(result)
}
zscore(25.77, 23.54, 2.442)
```

#Question 4: 
Use and show R code to round your z score answer in problem 3 to the nearest
tenth.
```{r}
round(.9131859, digits = 3)
```

#Question 5:
Write a function (using R code and the structure demonstrated in class) to
calculate the natural log of a number multiplied by the common log of the same
number divided by the cube root of a given prime number.

Use your function to find the answer if the number to be used for both log
expressions is 32 and the given prime number is 11.
```{r}
numberLog <- function(log,log10,cuberoot)
  {result <- ((log*log10)/(cuberoot))
    return(result)
    }

numberLog (32, 32, 11)

(log(32)*(log10(32)))/(11^(1/3))
```

#Question 6:
Use and show R code to round your answer in problem 5 to the nearest
hundredth.
```{r}
round(2.345548, digit = 2)
```

#Question 7:
Write a function (using R code and the structure demonstrated in class) that will
create the first 10 squares of positive odd integers. Your function should give you
the following output. 1, 9, 25, 49, â€¦, 361 when you input values 1 to 10.
```{r}
list <- c()
for (n in seq(1, 10)) {
    y = 2*n-1
    list[[n]] <- y*y
  }

for (n  in list) {
	print(n)
  }
```
